ðŸ§© Image-Sensor BGA Alignment for KiCad
BGA Alignment Footprint Generator
This repository contains a Python tool with a PyQt5 GUI to automatically generate KiCad BGA package footprints for image sensor devices.
It eliminates the need for manually placing pads, optical frames, and mounting holes by generating a complete .kicad_mod footprint file from user-defined parameters.
